Studied the difference between REACT function and class components.
Practiced with using PROPS in these class based components, like passing News titles, Images, Hyperlinks between different components.
Practiced with handling state using “this.state ={}” and “setState() => {}” in these components like loading recent news articles from an Api.
Implemented an Async function which Fetches news articles from an Api and populates the news cards.
Created a functionality of traversing between new and previous news articles.
Thus made a REACT News App.
