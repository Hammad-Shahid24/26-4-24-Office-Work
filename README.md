Studied the difference between REACT function and class components.
Practiced with using PROPS in these class based components, like passing News titles, Images, Hyperlinks between different components.
Practiced with handling state using “this.state ={}” and “setState() => {}” in these components like loading recent news articles from an Api.
Implemented an Async function which Fetches news articles from an Api and populates the news cards.
Created a functionality of traversing between new and previous news articles.
Thus made a REACT News App.

Implemented React Router in the app to switch between various news categories ( business, health, entertainment etc. ).
Implemented Default Props and Prop Types in the Class based React component.
Placed a Loading Spinner whenever a loading event happens in the App like fetching news article.
Tweaked the News App Ui a bit.
Improved the Functions which fetched the news articles and updated the state variables.
Learned the React Component Lifecycle & Lifecycle methods.
Used REACT_INFINITE_SCROLL npm package in order to implement pagination in my news app.
Passed Functions as State Variables between different components.
Used the REACT_TOP_LOADING_BAR cpm package in order to display a loading indicator everytime the news articles load.
